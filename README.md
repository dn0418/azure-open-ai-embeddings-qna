# Azure OpenAI Embeddings QnA

A simple web application for a OpenAI-enabled document search. This repo uses Azure OpenAI Service for creating embeddings vectors from documents. For answering the question of a user, it retrieves the most relevant document and then uses GPT-3 to extract the matching answer for the question.

# Running this repo
You have multiple options to run the code:
-   [Run everything locally in Docker (WebApp + Redis Stack)](#run-everything-locally-in-docker-webapp--redis-stack)
-   [Run everything locally in Python with Conda (WebApp only)](#run-everything-locally-in-python-with-conda-webapp-only)
-   [Run everything locally in Python with venv](#run-everything-locally-in-python-with-venv)
-   [Run WebApp locally in Docker against an existing Redis deployment](#run-webapp-locally-in-docker-against-an-existing-redis-deployment)

## Run everything locally in Docker (WebApp + Redis Stack)

First, clone the repo:

```console
git clone https://github.com/ruoccofabrizio/azure-open-ai-embeddings-qna
cd azure-open-ai-embeddings-qna
```

Next, configure your `.env` as described in [Environment variables](#environment-variables):


```console
cp .env.template .env
vi .env # or use whatever you feel comfortable with
```

Finally run the application:

```console
docker compose up
```

Open your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

This will spin up two Docker containers:
-   The WebApp itself
-   Redis Stack for storing the embeddings

## Run everything locally in Python with Conda (WebApp only)

This requires Redis running somewhere and expects that you've setup `.env` as described above. In this case, point `REDIS_ADDRESS` to your Redis deployment. 

You can run a local Redis instance via:
```console
 docker run -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest`.
```

Create `conda` environment for Python:

```console
conda env create -f code/environment.yml
conda activate openai-qna-env
```

Configure your `.env` as described in as described in [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

Run WebApp:
```console
cd code
streamlit run OpenAI_Queries.py
```

## Run everything locally in Python with venv
This requires Redis running somewhere and expects that you've setup `.env` as described above. In this case, point `REDIS_ADDRESS` to your Redis deployment. 

You can run a local Redis instance via:
```console
 docker run -p 6379:6379 redis/redis-stack-server:latest
```

Please ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.

Create `venv` environment for Python:

```console
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install `PIP` Requirements
```console
pip install -r code\requirements.txt
```

Configure your `.env` as described in as described in [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

Run the WebApp
```console
cd code
streamlit run OpenAI_Queries.py
```

## Run WebApp locally in Docker against an existing Redis deployment

### Option 1 - Run the prebuilt Docker image

Configure your `.env` as described in as described in [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

Then run:

```console
docker run -e .env -p 8080:80 fruocco/oai-embeddings:latest
```

### Option 2 - Build the Docker image yourself

Configure your `.env` as described in as described in [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

```console
docker build . -t your_docker_registry/your_docker_image:your_tag
docker run -e .env -p 8080:80 your_docker_registry/your_docker_image:your_tag
```
